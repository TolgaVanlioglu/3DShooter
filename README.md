# 3DShooter
 A game which displays its 2D game map as 3D

This is a proof-of-concept I made, which is essentially a top-down shooter but the objects are displayed in a 3D space, inspired by the original Doom.

(3DShooter.yyp is used to open the project in Gamemaker Studio 2, and 3DShooter.zip has the compiled .exe)
